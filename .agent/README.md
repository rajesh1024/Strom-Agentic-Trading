# STROM Bootstrap Pack (Antigravity + Specs)

This zip contains:
- `.antigravity/` — strict AI orchestration rules + agent prompts + milestone plan (M0–M2)
- `specs/` — authoritative starter specifications (architecture, data model, APIs, events, security, backtesting)

Purpose:
- Prevent hallucinations and skipped work by making interfaces explicit before implementation.
- Provide a runnable, testable path for Milestones M0–M2 (simulated market + paper trading).

Next step:
- Use `.antigravity/agents/conductor.md` as the first prompt in Antigravity.
