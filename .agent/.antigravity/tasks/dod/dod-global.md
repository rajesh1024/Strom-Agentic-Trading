# Global Definition of Done (All Tasks)

A task is DONE only when:
- Outputs match the task contract (exact files/paths)
- Tests added/updated and passing
- Docs updated if interfaces changed
- No SPEC GAP remains unresolved for the task area
- QA signs off (and Security signs off if auth/keys/sandbox touched)
