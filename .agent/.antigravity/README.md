# STROM — Antigravity Pack

This folder contains strict orchestration rules and agent prompts for building STROM using AI (Antigravity + Claude Code).

Key principles:
- SPEV loop: Spec → Plan → Execute → Verify
- Specs are the single source of truth. No invented APIs/events.
- Every task has Inputs/Outputs/DoD/Dependencies.
- No task is closed without verifier sign-off.

Files of record:
- .antigravity/rules.md
- .antigravity/workflow.md
- .antigravity/tasks/milestone-plan-m0-m2.md
